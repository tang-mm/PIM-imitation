File to execute: 

- MFCC matrix files:
dimension (37 * nb_observations). C0 is related to energy; delta and delta-delta are calculated for C1-C12, thus forming 12*3+1=37 lines.

- C1 to C12 are extracted to train GMM machine, get GMM model.
(?? train with 37 and then extract, OR, extract and train?)

- 
===== Python ===================
*** readMatrix.py
- Open text files containing MFCC matrix and return a 2D numpy array (matrix).
- Matrix shape: (nb_cluster * 12).


*** bob_gmm.py
- Call readMatrix function, initiate a GMM machine and train with the MFCC data (c1-c12). Return the trained GMM model.
- GMM means matrix shape: (nb_cluster * 12).


*** bob_pca.py
- concatenate all files of the same imitators imitating different speakers, forming a matrix of shape ( (nb_cluster*nb_file) * 12).
